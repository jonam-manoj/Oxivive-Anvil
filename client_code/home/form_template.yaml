      Under normal circumstances, oxygen is absorbed into circulation when we breathe and transported throughout the body only by red blood cells.  Under pressure, oxygen can be dissolved into all of the bodyâ€™s fluids, the plasma, the lymphatic system, the central nervous system fluids, and the bone. This allows us to dissolve, transport and deliver many more times the normal oxygen to our tissues and cells.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the quality of life of the patient in many areas. Many conditions such as PTSD and stroke have responded favorably to hyperbaric treatment.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the  quality of life of the patient in many areas.

      Hyperbarics is a safe alternative to many medical treatment options offered to patients today. Some hyperbaric patients may report some mild ear pressure discomfort. This discomfort is similar to the pressure felt when ascending or descending in an airplane. Discuss these concerns with your physician and hyperbaric therapy professional.

      Our clinics provide a safe, comfortable and welcoming environment for your hyperbaric therapy needs. We have hard and soft sided chambers in our offices and offer mild to high pressure depending on the needs of our patients.

      Our in-home HBOT therapy chambers offer you the benefits of oxygen therapy right in your home. Our chambers offer you all the benefits of HBOT therapy without the hassle and emotional
      Most definitely. Hyperbarics is great for those in their later years. Hyperbarics provides an immeasurable boost which counteracts the signs of aging. In fact, new research indictes that hyperbaric oxygenation slows Apoptosis (cell death), and helps with diabetic neuropathy, dementia, Alzheimerâ€™s and overall energy and healing.

      Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a treatment in which a patient breathes air or varying amounts of oxygen while inside a pressurized chamber, the pressure being anything above 1 atmosphere.

      The healing power of oxygen is not something new. The use of hyperbaric therapy dates back nearly 350 years. The very first hyperbaric chamber was created in 1662 with the clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy starting in the mid 1800s. During the 1960s, studies began to show a wide variety of beneficial uses for HBOT therapy. Today, there are over 150 internationally approved conditions for which hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to be effective and beneficial.Traditionally HBOT has been used for diabetic foot wounds, air and gas embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning and smoke inhalation, gas gangrene, thermal burns, decompression sickness and acute mountain sickness.

      Today, we help treat everything from diabetes, low energy, Lyme disease, cerebral palsy, head injuries, chronic fatigue, brain injuries, multiple sclerosis, ALS, anemia, wound and scar healing, post stroke care, post surgical care and healing, improved performance, autism, dementia and bells palsy just to name a few.

      At OXIVIVE we offer treatments in our clinics as well as in-home HBOT chambers. Call to learn more about the benefits of HBOT therapy.

      No. Keep in mind that the â€™40 hour protocolâ€™ is the gold standard for many of the physiological benefits that have been observed with HBOT. However, the actual physiological benefits (for HBOT) can be seen in just a few sessions!
      Most physiological benefits will begin within the first few sessions of HBOT. It has been well documented that the anti-oxidant and protective role of HBOT is immediate and demonstrated within 24 hours of just one hyperbaric session. Further to this, the anti-inflammatory response is quite also very quick and a strong physiological response has been shown within 4 days of hyperbaric therapy. Many studies have reported HBOT to produce a strong pain relieving effect after just 5 to 10 sessions. HBOTâ€™s effects on promoting new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) can take place in just 10 to 20
      sessions. From our data, here is a general summary:
      1-5 sessions: Improve cellular energy and during this time tissue functioning may be optimized. Those with residual carbon monoxide (ie smokers) or with mild anemia can show immediate benefits with cellular energy. Inflammatory markers can go down considerably and mark the beginning of a natural repair process.
      5-10 sessions: Typically used for acute injuries with soft tissue damage, particularly if there is pain involved.
      10-20 sessions: More serious acute injuries or chronic injuries
      20-40 sessions: Commonly used for major tissue damages and when new tissue is required (through HBOTâ€™s regenerative stem cell properties)
